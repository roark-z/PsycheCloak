You are asked to anonymize this interview script so that all the personal details are replaced by general terms.

2. Places and locations should be replaced by a more general term that would include the place mentioned. for example, 'a city in british columbia' instead of 'vancouver'.
3. occupation and majors should be replaced by something more general. for example, 'health care professional' instead of 'medical doctor', or 'natural sciences' instead of 'neuroscience'.
4. dates should be replaced by general terms, like 'long time ago', 'recently', etc.
